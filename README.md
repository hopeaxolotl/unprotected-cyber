Unprotected Cyber is a system hardening script built primarily for the securing of CyberCenturion/Patriot competition scenarios. It is now primarily used as a tool to quickly configure and edit certain Linux scripts. 
<br>
<br>
Unprotected Cyber is primarily made in Python, along with a compilation of Bash files, who's primary purpose is to configure files to be as secure as possible. It is also possible to mod, using the bash files provided in the /unproc/opts, /unproc/misc, /unproc/service and /unproc/man folders. 
<br>
<br>
The legacy version of the script of which this script is based on the I am Root CyberCenturion Script and the Gl0ckrain CyberCenturion Script.

## General Usage
 - Automatic scripts are blocks of individual scripts (manual scripts) bunched together for convenience.
 - Each individual manual script contains a unit of code dedicated to a single configuration/purpose, for example, "Malware and Updates".
## Misc/Services/Optional Usage
 - Miscellaneous scripts are made of miscellaneous scripts and lines of code that don't fit into any one category.
 - Services scripts are made of a single script used to configure a Linux service, for example SSH.
 - Optional scripts are scripts that aren't really needed for a secure system but added for convenience, for example the "Autoremove" option.
